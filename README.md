# SafePlay Kids

**SafePlay Kids** is an Android application built with a mission to provide a safer YouTube viewing experience for children. Using the YouTube Data API, it allows **parents to select specific channels and videos**, which are then displayed to their kids in a clean, controlled interfaceâ€”free from distractions, Shorts, or irrelevant recommendations.

### Key Features:
- Search and select **only child-safe videos or channels**
- **Parent-controlled video library**: no direct searching by kids
- **Filtered experience** that hides Shorts and unrelated content
- Planned support for **offline video info caching** to reduce API usage

This app is designed with privacy and safety in mind, making YouTube more accessible and secure for younger audiences.
